# Server will act as a reference guide to where files are located.
# It will provide a client an adequate host (maybe not implement this yet as it is out of scope)
# It should also store the information of the user, login credentials and a random index to each file
# of the user. The index will be used to ask the hosts to retrieve a file, making the hosts unable to
# check which file they are storing
